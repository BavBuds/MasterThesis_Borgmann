# Master Thesis Borgmann
## Project Overview

This project is part of my MSc thesis in Agricultural Bioscience under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Tellier. The focus of the research is on the genomic changes in the Murex species before, during, and after the exploitation by the Romans. We aim to harvest whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, process them, and align them with existing datasets. Our goal is to perform phylogenetic footprinting to identify genes involved in the dye synthesis pathway and analyze changes in population structure over time.

## Objectives

- Harvest and process WGS data from Murex species.
- Align new data with existing genomic datasets.
- Perform phylogenetic footprinting to identify key genes.
- Analyze changes in population structure related to dye synthesis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather WGS data from various Murex species.
2. **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the raw sequencing data.
3. **Alignment**: Align the processed data with existing genomic sequences.
4. **Phylogenetic Footprinting**: Identify genes involved in dye synthesis.
5. **Population Structure Analysis**: Examine changes in population structure over time.

## Expected Outcomes

- Identification of genomic changes in Murex species due to Roman exploitation.
- Insights into the genetic basis of dye synthesis in Murex species.
- Understanding of population structure dynamics in historical contexts.
